# Notes

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string
(`pindrop_version_string`), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from
consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect your
application at all.  We use this information to let us know if Pindrop is useful
and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open source, you are
free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if you would leave it
in.
